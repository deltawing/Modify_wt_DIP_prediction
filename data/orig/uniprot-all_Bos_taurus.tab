Note=Detected in the cytoplasm of B-cells stimulated to switch. Colocalized with SIRT1 in the nucleus. Colocalized with YBX1 in nuclear speckles after genotoxic stress. Together with OGG1 is recruited to nuclear speckles in UVA-irradiated cells. Colocalized with nucleolin and NPM1 in the nucleolus. Its nucleolar localization is cell cycle dependent and requires active rRNA transcription. Colocalized with calreticulin in the endoplasmic reticulum. Translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm is stimulated in presence of nitric oxide (NO) and function in a CRM1-dependent manner, possibly as a consequence of demasking a nuclear export signal (amino acid position 64-80). S-nitrosylation at Cys-93 and Cys-310 regulates its nuclear-cytosolic shuttling. Ubiquitinated form is localized predominantly in the cytoplasm.; SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: DNA-(apurinic or apyrimidinic site) lyase, mitochondrial: Mitochondrion. Note=Translocation from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria is mediated by ROS signaling and cleavage mediated by granzyme A.

Note=Assembly of CENPS and CENPX and its partner subunits CENPT and CENPW at centromeres occurs through a dynamic exchange mechanism. Although exchange is continuous in the cell cycle, de novo assembly starts principally during mid-late S phase and is complete by G2. CENPS is more stably bound at the kinetochore than CENPX. During S phase, rapidly recruited to DNA interstrand cross-links that block replication. Recruited to DNA damage sites about 20 minutes following UV irradiation, reaching a plateau after approximately 40 minutes. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q8N2Z9}.

The majority of beta-catenin is localized to the cell membrane. In interphase, colocalizes with CROCC between CEP250 puncta at the proximal end of centrioles, and this localization is dependent on CROCC and CEP250. In mitosis, when NEK2 activity increases, it localizes to centrosomes at spindle poles independent of CROCC.

Cytoplasmic vesicle membrane {ECO:0000250}; Single-pass type II membrane protein {ECO:0000250}. Cell membrane {ECO:0000250}. Note=Colocalizes, during muscle differentiation, with BIN1 in the T-tubule system of myotubules and at the site of contact between two myotubes or a myoblast and a myotube. Wounding of myotubes led to its focal enrichment to the site of injury and to its relocalization in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner toward the plasma membrane. Colocalizes with AHNAK, AHNAK2 and PARVB at the sarcolemma of skeletal muscle. Detected on the apical plasma membrane of the syncytiotrophoblast. Reaches the plasmma membrane through a caveolin-independent mechanism. Retained by caveolin at the plasmma membrane (By similarity). Colocalizes, during muscle differentiation, with CACNA1S in the T-tubule system of myotubules (By similarity). Accumulates and colocalizes with fusion vesicles at the sarcolemma disruption sites (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}.

Note=Shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus. Largely nuclear in unstimulated cells. In osteoblasts, colocalizes with ATF4 and RUNX2 in the nucleus. Insulin-induced phosphorylation at Ser-226 by PKB/AKT1 leads, via stimulation of Thr-24 phosphorylation, to binding of 14-3-3 proteins and nuclear export to the cytoplasm where it is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteosomal pathway. Phosphorylation at Ser-219 by CDK1 disrupts binding of 14-3-3 proteins and promotes nuclear accumulation. Phosphorylation by NLK results in nuclear export. Translocates to the nucleus upon oxidative stress-induced phosphorylation at Ser-212 by STK4/MST1. SGK1-mediated phosphorylation also results in nuclear translocation. Retained in the nucleus under stress stimuli including oxidative stress, nutrient deprivation or nitric oxide. Retained in the nucleus on methylation (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}.

Note=In macrophages, under resting conditions, mainly located in the cytosol, on the endoplasmic reticulum. After stimulation with inducers of the NLRP3 inflammasome, mitochondria redistribute in the vicinity of the endoplasmic reticulum in the perinuclear region, which results in colocalization of NLRP3 on the endoplasmic reticulum and PYCARD on mitochondria, allowing the activation of inflammasome assembly. After the induction of pyroptosis, inflammasome specks are released into the extracellular space where they can further promote IL1B processing and where they can be engulfed by macrophages. Phagocytosis induces lysosomal damage and inflammasome activation in the recipient cells (By similarity). In the Th2 subset of CD4(+) helper T-cells, mainly located in the nucleus. Nuclear localization depends upon KPNA2. In the Th1 subset of CD4(+) helper T-cells, mainly cytoplasmic (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q8R4B8, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q96P20}.

In response to inflammasome-activating signals, such as ATP for NLRP3 inflammasome or bacterial flagellin for NLRC4 inflammasome, cleaved and secreted. IL1B lacks any known signal sequence and the pathway(s) of its secretion is(are) not yet fully understood. On the basis of experimental results, several unconventional secretion mechanisms have been proposed. 1. Secretion via secretory lysosomes: a fraction of CASP1 and IL1B precursor may be incorporated, by a yet undefined mechanism, into secretory lysosomes that undergo Ca(2+)-dependent exocytosis with release of mature IL1B. 2. Secretory autophagy: IL1B-containing autophagosomes may fuse with endosomes or multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and then merge with the plasma membrane releasing soluble IL1B or IL1B-containing exosomes. However, autophagy impacts IL1B production at several levels and its role in secretion is still controversial. 3. Secretion via exosomes: ATP-activation of P2RX7 leads to the formation of MVBs containing exosomes with entrapped IL1B, CASP1 and other inflammasome components. These MVBs undergo exocytosis with the release of exosomes. The release of soluble IL1B occurs after the lysis of exosome membranes. 4. Secretion by microvesicle shedding: activation of the ATP receptor P2RX7 may induce an immediate shedding of membrane-derived microvesicles containing IL1B and possibly inflammasome components. The cytokine is then released in the extracellular compartment after microvesicle lysis. 5. Release by translocation through permeabilized plasma membrane. This may occur in cells undergoing pyroptosis due to sustained activation of the inflammasome. These mechanisms may not be not mutually exclusive. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P01584, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P10749}.

O97593	reviewed	Bos taurus (Bovine)	SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus. Chromosome. Chromosome, centromere. Note=Associates with chromatin. The phosphorylated form on Ser-957 and Ser-966 associates with chromatin during G1/S/G2 phases but not during M phase, suggesting that phosphorylation does not regulate cohesin function (By similarity). Before prophase it is scattered along chromosome arms. During prophase, most of cohesin complexes dissociate from chromatin probably because of phosphorylation by PLK, except at centromeres, where cohesin complexes remain. At anaphase, the RAD21 subunit of the cohesin complex is cleaved, leading to the dissociation of the complex from chromosomes, allowing chromosome separation. In germ cells, cohesin complex dissociates from chromatin at prophase I, and may be replaced by a meiosis-specific cohesin complex. {ECO:0000250}.
