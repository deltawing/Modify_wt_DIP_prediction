Membrane, clathrin-coated pit {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15677459}. Note=Cell surface protein that rapidly becomes internalized via clathrin-coated pits. During maturation, the immature APP (N-glycosylated in the endoplasmic reticulum) moves to the Golgi complex where complete maturation occurs (O-glycosylated and sulfated). After alpha-secretase cleavage, soluble APP is released into the extracellular space and the C-terminal is internalized to endosomes and lysosomes. Some APP accumulates in secretory transport vesicles leaving the late Golgi compartment and returns to the cell surface. Gamma-CTF(59) peptide is located to both the cytoplasm and nuclei of neurons. It can be translocated to the nucleus through association with APBB1 (Fe65). Beta-APP42 associates with FPRL1 at the cell surface and the complex is then rapidly internalized (By similarity). APP sorts to the basolateral surface in epithelial cells (By similarity). During neuronal differentiation, the Thr-743 phosphorylated form is located mainly in growth cones, moderately in neurites and sparingly in the cell body. Casein kinase phosphorylation can occur either at the cell surface or within a post-Golgi compartment. Associates with GPC1 in perinuclear compartments. {ECO:0000250}.

Cytoplasm. Note=Colocalized with SIRT1 in the nucleus. Colocalized with YBX1 in nuclear speckles after genotoxic stress. Together with OGG1 is recruited to nuclear speckles in UVA-irradiated cells. Colocalized with nucleolin and NPM1 in the nucleolus. Its nucleolar localization is cell cycle dependent and requires active rRNA transcription. Colocalized with calreticulin in the endoplasmic reticulum. Translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm is stimulated in presence of nitric oxide (NO) and function in a CRM1-dependent manner, possibly as a consequence of demasking a nuclear export signal (amino acid position 63-79). S-nitrosylation at Cys-92 and Cys-309 regulates its nuclear-cytosolic shuttling. Ubiquitinated form is localized predominantly in the cytoplasm. Detected in the cytoplasm of B-cells stimulated to switch (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}.; SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: DNA-(apurinic or apyrimidinic site) lyase, mitochondrial: Mitochondrion. Note=Translocation from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria is mediated by ROS signaling and cleavage mediated by granzyme A.

Note=In interphase cells, the majority of the condensin complex is found in the cytoplasm, while a minority of the complex is associated with chromatin. A subpopulation of the complex however remains associated with chromosome foci in interphase cells. During mitosis, most of the condensin complex is associated with the chromatin. At the onset of prophase, the regulatory subunits of the complex are phosphorylated by CDK1, leading to condensin's association with chromosome arms and to chromosome condensation. Dissociation from chromosomes is observed in late telophase (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}.

Note=It is nucleoplasmic through most of the cell cycle and associates with replication foci during S-phase. In germ cells, spermatogonia, preleptotene and leptotene spermatocytes all express high levels of nuclear protein, while the protein is not detected in pachytene spermatocytes, despite the fact they expressed high levels of mRNA. In females, the protein is not detected in non-growing oocytes, in contrast to the growing oocytes. During the growing, the protein is no longer detectable in nuclei but accumulates to very high levels first throughout the cytoplasm. At the time of ovulation, all the protein is cytoplasmic and is actively associated with the oocyte cortex. After fecondation, in the preimplantation embryo, the protein remains cytoplasmic and after implantation, it is exclusively nuclear in all tissue types. Isoform 2 is sequestered in the cytoplasm of maturing oocytes and of preimplantation embryos, except for the 8-cell stage, while isoform 1 is exclusively nuclear.

In osteoblasts, colocalizes with ATF4 and RUNX2 in the nucleus (By similarity). Insulin-induced phosphorylation at Ser-253 by PKB/AKT1 leads, via stimulation of Thr-24 phosphorylation, to binding of 14-3-3 proteins and nuclear export to the cytoplasm where it is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteosomal pathway. Phosphorylation at Ser-249 by CDK1 disrupts binding of 14-3-3 proteins and promotes nuclear accumulation. Phosphorylation by NLK results in nuclear export. Translocates to the nucleus upon oxidative stress-induced phosphorylation at Ser-212 by STK4/MST1. SGK1-mediated phosphorylation also results in nuclear translocation. Retained in the nucleus under stress stimuli including oxidative stress, nutrient deprivation or nitric oxide. Methylated form is nuclear. {ECO:0000250}.

Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:26098997}. Note=In macrophages, under resting conditions, mainly located in the cytosol, on the endoplasmic reticulum. After stimulation with inducers of the NLRP3 inflammasome, mitochondria redistribute in the vicinity of the endoplasmic reticulum in the perinuclear region, which results in colocalization of NLRP3 on the endoplasmic reticulum and PYCARD on mitochondria, allowing the activation of inflammasome assembly (PubMed:23502856). After the induction of pyroptosis, inflammasome specks are released into the extracellular space where they can further promote IL1B processing and where they can be engulfed by macrophages. Phagocytosis induces lysosomal damage and inflammasome activation in the recipient cells (PubMed:24952505)(PubMed:24952504). In the Th2 subset of CD4(+) helper T-cells, mainly located in the nucleus.

Note=Tyrosine phosphorylation seems to occur only at the cell membrane. Translocates to the cell membrane following insulin stimulation by a mechanism that involves binding to GRB14 and INSR. SRC and HSP90 promote its localization to the cell membrane. Its nuclear localization is dependent on its association with PTPN6 and its phosphorylation at Ser-396. Restricted to the nucleus in neuronal cells while in non-neuronal cells it is found in the cytoplasm. The Ser-244 phosphorylated form is distributed along the perinuclear region in neuronal cells while in non-neuronal cells it is found in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. IGF1 transiently increases phosphorylation at Ser-241 of neuronal PDPK1, resulting in its translocation to other cellular compartments. The tyrosine-phosphorylated form colocalizes with PTK2B in focal adhesions after angiotensin II stimulation (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}.

Note=Localizes to punctate cytoplasmic foci which do not appear to overlap with early or late endosomes, the endoplasmic reticulum, multivesicular bodies (MVBs), lysosomes, or mitochondria (PubMed:12075009). Often found in close association with microtubules (PubMed:12075009). Does not associate with the Golgi complex (PubMed:12075009). During spermiogenesis, it localizes to the manchette in spermatids from steps 8-10 (PubMed:12075009). It is also present between the microtubule manchette and the nucleus (PubMed:12075009). During manchette elongation, it is preferentially localized to the nuclear ring of the manchette, whereas the strong localization to the manchette decreases (PubMed:12075009). In more mature spermatids, while the manchette migrates posteriorly, it localizes to punctuates spots (PubMed:12075009). At later stages of spermatid differentiation, the punctuate expression pattern is found at both the attachment site and the proximal end of the elongated manchette (PubMed:12075009). In contrast, it is not present in mature spermatozoa (PubMed:12075009). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12075009}.

In the cytoplasm, localizes in cytoplasmic mRNP granules. Colocalizes with microtubules in growth cone filopodia and along neurites in neuronal cells (By similarity). Cytoplasmic colocalization with ACTB mRNA is partially lost at the cell periphery, suggesting release of the transcript (By similarity). In hippocampal neurons, predominantly located within dendrites, particularly at dendritic branching points in young cells, compared to axons (By similarity). In axons, predominantly found in axonal branches and their growth cones (By similarity). In neuronal processes, exhibits fast retrograde and anterograde movements, when associated with ACTB mRNA; this motility is lost when the association is inhibited (By similarity). Dendritic levels are regulated by neuronal activity and glutaminergic signals: they are increased by KCl-induced depolarization, which induces rapid efflux from the cell body into dendrites, and decreased by NMDA receptor agonists (By similarity). In motile cells, such as migrating fibroblasts, localizes to leading edges where it colocalizes with microtubules and microfilaments and to retracting tails (By similarity). In motile cells, transported towards the leading edge into the cortical region of the lamellipodia where it is connected to microfilaments (By similarity). In response to cellular stress, such as oxidative stress or heat shock, recruited to stress granules, but not to processing bodies (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}.

Q6PDM4	reviewed	Mus musculus (Mouse)	SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Chromosome {ECO:0000269|PubMed:27723721}. Note=Specifically localizes to unsynapsed chromosomal regions during meiosis (PubMed:27723721). Appears on chromatin during preleptotene, when pre-meiotic replication occurs and axes have not yet developed (PubMed:27723721). Remains associated with unsynapsed axesn zygotene, when axes elongate and synapsis begins but disappears from synapsed axes (PubMed:27723721). Localization diverges in the two sexes beyond zygotene (PubMed:27723721). In spermatocytes, synapsis between the largely non-homologous X and Y chromosomes is mostly constrained to their short pseudoautosomal regions (PARs) (PubMed:27723721). At the zygotene-to-pachytene transition, high levels remain on unsynapsed sex chromosome axes but also on PARs (PubMed:27723721). However, by early pachytene disappears from both the synapsed and unsynapsed regions of sex chromosomes (PubMed:27723721). Reaccumulates on unsynapsed axes of sex chromosomes in mid-late pachytene and on desynapsing autosome axes in diplotene, but disappears from chromatin concomitant with axis disassembly after diplotene (PubMed:27723721). In oocytes, disappears from axes after all chromosomes synapsed and is undetectable on chromatin beyond zygotene (PubMed:27723721). Ovarian levels also dramatically decrease as oocytes progress to late prophase (PubMed:27723721). HORMAD1 is required for robust accumulation on chromatin and unsynapsed axes, suggesting that HORMAD1 recruits IHO1/CCDC36 to unsynapsed axes (PubMed:27723721). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:27723721}.

In response to inflammasome-activating signals, such as ATP for NLRP3 inflammasome or bacterial flagellin for NLRC4 inflammasome, cleaved and secreted. IL1B lacks any known signal sequence and the pathway(s) of its secretion is(are) not yet fully understood. On the basis of experimental results, several unconventional secretion mechanisms have been proposed. 1. Secretion via secretory lysosomes: a fraction of CASP1 and IL1B precursor may be incorporated, by a yet undefined mechanism, into secretory lysosomes that undergo Ca(2+)-dependent exocytosis with release of mature IL1B (By similarity). 2. Secretory autophagy: IL1B-containing autophagosomes may fuse with endosomes or multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and then merge with the plasma membrane releasing soluble IL1B or IL1B-containing exosomes (By similarity). However, autophagy impacts IL1B production at several levels and its role in secretion is still controversial. 3. Secretion via exosomes: ATP-activation of P2RX7 leads to the formation of MVBs containing exosomes with entrapped IL1B, CASP1 and other inflammasome components. These MVBs undergo exocytosis with the release of exosomes. The release of soluble IL1B occurs after the lysis of exosome membranes (PubMed:17641058). 4. Secretion by microvesicle shedding: activation of the ATP receptor P2RX7 may induce an immediate shedding of membrane-derived microvesicles containing IL1B and possibly inflammasome components. The cytokine is then released in the extracellular compartment after microvesicle lysis (By similarity). 5. Release by translocation through permeabilized plasma membrane. This may occur in cells undergoing pyroptosis due to sustained activation of the inflammasome (PubMed:17284521). These mechanisms may not be not mutually exclusive. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P01584, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17284521, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17641058}.

Note=Component of the meiotic nuage, also named P granule, a germ-cell-specific organelle required to repress transposon activity during meiosis. Recruited to perinuclear nuage during spermatogenesis. Specifically localizes to piP-bodies, a subset of the nuage which contains secondary piRNAs. PIWIL2 is required for its localization to piP-bodies. PubMed:16787967, reported an association with the nuclear XY body, however, PubMed:18694567 showed that it is not the case because the antibody used by PubMed:16787967 still stains the nuclear XY body in spermatocytes lacking Mael. Moreover other antibodies raized against the same epitope used in PubMed:16787967 do not recognize any epitopes on XY chromosomes but show a clear localization to the meiotic nuage.

Q9CU62	reviewed	Mus musculus (Mouse)	SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus. Chromosome. Chromosome, centromere. Note=Associates with chromatin. The phosphorylated form on Ser-957 and Ser-966 associates with chromatin during G1/S/G2 phases but not during M phase, suggesting that phosphorylation does not regulate cohesin function (By similarity). Before prophase it is scattered along chromosome arms. During prophase, most of cohesin complexes dissociate from chromatin probably because of phosphorylation by PLK, except at centromeres, where cohesin complexes remain. At anaphase, the RAD21 subunit of the cohesin complex is cleaved, leading to the dissociation of the complex from chromosomes, allowing chromosome separation. In germ cells, cohesin complex dissociates from chromatin at prophase I, and may be replaced by a meiosis-specific cohesin complex. {ECO:0000250}.

In prophase I stage of meiosis, localizes along the AE of synaptonemal complexes. In late-pachytene-diplotene, the bulk of protein dissociates from the chromosome arms probably because of phosphorylation by PLK, except at centromeres, where cohesin complexes remain. Remains chromatin associated at the centromeres up to metaphase II. At anaphase II, dissociates from centromeres, allowing chromosomes segregation.

Note=In interphase cells, the majority of the condensin complex is found in the cytoplasm, while a minority of the complex is associated with chromatin. A subpopulation of the complex however remains associated with chromosome foci in interphase cells. During mitosis, most of the condensin complex is associated with the chromatin. At the onset of prophase, the regulatory subunits of the complex are phosphorylated by CDC2, leading to condensin's association with chromosome arms and to chromosome condensation. Dissociation from chromosomes is observed in late telophase (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}.

Note=Associates with chromatin. Before prophase it is scattered along chromosome arms. During prophase, most of cohesin complexes dissociate from chromatin probably because of phosphorylation by PLK, except at centromeres, where cohesin complexes remain. At anaphase, the RAD21 subunit of the cohesin complex is cleaved, leading to the dissociation of the complex from chromosomes, allowing chromosome separation. The phosphorylated form at Ser-1083 is preferentially associated with unsynapsed chromosomal regions.

Q9D3E6	reviewed	Mus musculus (Mouse)	SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00750}. Chromosome {ECO:0000250}. Note=Associates with chromatin. Before prophase it is scattered along chromosome arms. During prophase, most of cohesin complexes dissociate from chromatin probably because of phosphorylation by PLK1, except at centromeres, where cohesin complexes remain. At anaphase, the RAD21 subunit of cohesin is cleaved, leading to the dissociation of the complex from chromosomes, allowing chromosome separation (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}.

Chromosome, centromere {ECO:0000269|PubMed:22346761}. Note=Associates with chromatin. In prophase I stage of meiosis, it is found along the axial elements of synaptonemal complexes. In late-pachytene-diplotene, the bulk of protein dissociates from the chromosome arms probably because of phosphorylation by PLK1, except at centromeres, where cohesin complexes remain. It however remains chromatin associated at the centromeres up to metaphase I. During anaphase I, it probably dissociates from centromeres, allowing chromosomes segregation.

Before prophase it is scattered along chromosome arms. During prophase, most of cohesin complexes dissociate from chromatin probably because of phosphorylation by PLK1, except at centromeres, where cohesin complexes remain. At anaphase, the RAD21 subunit of cohesin is cleaved, leading to the dissociation of the complex from chromosomes, allowing chromosome separation. In germ cells, cohesin complex dissociates from chromatin at prophase I, and may be replaced by a meiosis-specific cohesin complex (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}.

Remains localized to the nuclear membrane after poliovirus (PV) infection. During mitosis, remains associated with the nuclear envelope until prometaphase. Associated with the mitotic spindle from late prometaphase until anaphase. Reorganized during mitosis in a viscous and dynamic nuclear-derived spindle matrix that embeds the microtubule spindle apparatus from pole to pole in a microtubule-independent manner. Recruited to the reforming nuclear envelope during telophase and cytokinesis. Detected at kinetochores during prometaphase. Colocalizes with MAD2L1 in the spindle matrix but not at kinetochore. Colocalizes with dynein, dynactin, tubulin at kinetochore during the metaphase-anaphase transition.
