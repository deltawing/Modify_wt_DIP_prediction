Cytoplasm, cell cortex. Cell junction, plasmodesma. Note=Present in MT cortical arrays. Binds the preprophase band and the prophase spindle microtubule during prophase. Binds MT during anaphase. Associates also with phragmoplast; binds MT of young emerging phragmoplasts but don't binds along MT when the disk-shaped phragmoplasts transform into a ring-shaped, centrifugally expanding structure. At this time, accumulates in the cell plate and associates with the surface of the separated nuclei. Later traverses the newly formed cross wall, probably in association with plasmodesma.

Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Peripheral membrane protein {ECO:0000269|PubMed:24118572}. Note=In prometaphase, associated with the kinetochore. At metaphase, mostly associated with the spindle. In early anaphase, found in the vicinity of the centromere. As anaphase progresses, dispersed in the cytoplasm.
